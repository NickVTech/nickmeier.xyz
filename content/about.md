### In-depth Introduction:

#### Education and Academic Experience:

Originally, I entered college without a clear academic direction. Admittedly, my high school performance was average, with a GPA just around 3.0. Nevertheless, the collegiate environment fostered a newfound drive within me. After considerable introspection, I recognized my profound passion for computers, leading me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. 

My initial perception of computer engineering was primarily centered around its computing facets, slightly underestimating the depth of its electrical components. This realization was indeed surprising. 

College offered me more than just academic knowledge. The initial semesters were instrumental in honing my soft skills, such as effective communication with professors and peers, adopting efficient study techniques, building resilience in problem-solving, and understanding the importance of persistence.

**Current GPA**: 3.7

#### Journey with Computers:

**The Beginning**:
My tryst with computers began during my fifth-grade, driven primarily by games like Minecraft and Dota 2. As I grew, there were instances of dabbling with coding, but the allure of gaming overshadowed these pursuits.

**Historical Perspective**:
I have always been captivated by the evolution of computing. I regularly watch interviews by Lex Fridman with computing pioneers. Understanding the historical context of technological advancements allows me to appreciate the depth and significance of the solutions developed. This perspective not only enhances my technical understanding but provides a richer appreciation for the field as a whole.
