## The longer version

### Academics
I study a lot. I mean, a lot. I really put my heart into it. The reason I chose to
study computer engineering over science, was because I thought it would be
"low level computing" and not electrical. Boy was I shocked. 

// EDIT: Pun wasn't intended, considered removing.

I came into College not knowing what I wanted to do. I was honestly not
the best student in highschool. I did not apply myself. In all honesty,
I barely had a 3.0. I got into College as an undecided major. After doing
some internal searching, I had realized I loved computers(covered in next seciton), and it never
occoured to me that I could study them in school.

Since, I have had to learn how to learn. The first semester taught me the most ( soft skills )
such as asking for help, communicating with professors and classmates, study habits, mental stamina,
working on hard problems, and not giving up.

##### GPA: 3.7

Do you know how hard a 3.7 is to get? It is extremely hard in CPE. I often feel guilty in
some way for having it. I put in so much work, and often consider the sacrifices made.
I don't go out much, and this is because of the ammount of studying that goes into this.

I love the academic world ( as of now ).

### Computers
##### Early Days

My first laptop was when I was in 5th grade, that I mostly wanted for Minecraft and
Dota 2. I had been playing computer games since I can remember. Throughout my years, I had toyed around
with code, but it never stuck due to video games being more stimulating. 

##### History

I love the history of Computing. I often watch Lex Fridman interview's with some of the OG's
to be able to get a mental timeline of why and when things were developed. I find the the solution
makes so much more sense when you fundementally understand the problem. This is an ongoing journey,
but to learn about the past has really helped shaped my idea of computing.


##### Why I love them?

My love for computers is always changing, so I decided I was going to make this bulleted with time stamps.
- I feel like there are many aspects of computing that I apply to the framework of life and thought. For instance,
my internal RAM in my brain isn't as good as others, but my processesor and complex problem solving is really good. - *July 2023*
