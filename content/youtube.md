YouTube... I love you. Sincerely.
I watch YouTube everynight before bed. I feel like the creators on the platform put in the most effort. They genuinly care
about their content. Most platforms nowadays are stockpiled with people just trying to get famous.

Wherever my genuine interests lay, YouTube seems to recommend more of it to me. I have never had a problem with
garbage content appearing randomly. They have never steered me in a certain direction (as far as I'm concerned).

I created this section to allow you to keep updated with my current interests. This website is
linked to the videos, and I watch youtube everynight! Anything I like, should appear here. If you would to checkout
the full playlist, feel free to [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRwgaooAgnpVrBKsY1I0mOxET5hihbxPt).

How did I build this section?
- HUGO (The website)
- Golang (Functionality)
- Postman (Working with API)

How does it work?
- Since the site is static, it updates everytime I build the website again.
