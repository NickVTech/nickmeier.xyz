I turned 21 tonight!!!! LETS GOOOOO!
River gave me a lesson from NYLT. I wish I went. He told me what a "servant-leader" is. I love that term.

Ok now that I am legal, I will say hi to my older self. I hope this is archived because
as the darknet vendor said on my liked videos in my youtube playlist....
"dont drink and type" 

Whooops, I AM 21 I AM GOING TO AC ( atlantic city ) tommorrow!!!

future employers, I focus on skill. 

future nick... bro I cant believe this was ur 21st, I love you bro. Have a great time in atlantic city. This time stamp is funny
but you already know that. It's relieving because now you can be legal. Lowkey, HELLO WORLD!!!

GO GET EM TIGER. Energy is nuts. 

for those who are reading. You can view energy by:
- cooking bacon
- pouring greese into cup
- putting paper towel inside
- let cool for 30-1 hour
- lighting paper towel on fire

This is a bacon candle. Credits to Dragon Zhao
