Welcome to my website. Here, you can expect to find little updates on whatever I am doing. I encourage you all to checkout my github, as I am pretty active on it. I honestly have a huge passion for computers. Through this website, I hope to get a log on my skills and development. I think it would be pretty cool to look back in 10 years and see how much I have grew.

I understand I have a huge potential, and I am super excited to work towards that!
